### INFO
Pymumble come from [here](https://github.com/azlux/pymumble) it's a fork a the actuel [fork alive](https://github.com/Xefir/pymumble) of pymumble, I will upload this fork and the pymumble directory every time a will make changes on pymumble directory on MumbleRadioPlayer.
I done that because it's was too complicated to make a directory linked to the pymumble git.
